# Panopticon — Ticket Breakdown (V0)

> **Audio-only. Voice is the sole operational modality.** This document breaks the V0 implementation
> into **measurable, verifiable tickets**. Each ticket has a STABLE kebab-case id (it becomes a durable
> Smithers task id — never an index/timestamp), self-contained instructions for a fresh-context agent,
> `requirementIds` tracing to the PRD, a `verification[]` mix (command/e2e/agent-review) drawn from the
> backpressure matrix, `dependsOn[]`, and a complexity.
>
> **Upstream (read from disk, not assumed):** `docs/planning/01-prd.md` (REQ-1..16, D1–D6, §6 probes),
> `docs/planning/02-design.md` (D-DD-01..25, §11 probe surface, §13 matrix), `docs/planning/03-eng.md`
> (architecture, §17 probes, §18 traceability, **§22 round-1 probe results & amendments**),
> `docs/planning/04-backpressure.md` (the per-criterion gate matrix the verification entries are drawn
> from). Machine copy the implementation workflow imports: `artifacts/smithering/tickets.json`.
>
> **Validation is the centerpiece, not an afterthought.** Every ticket enumerates CONCRETE
> unit/integration command tests **AND** e2e tests (it is an AND — either layer alone should leave us
> fairly confident), plus agent-review entries for what only a smart agent can judge. Every test names
> the **red-before-green** failure injection that proves it can fail; "the agent said it's done" is
> never evidence. Third-party APIs are validated against the REAL library by a probe before any code is
> built on them. Every component emits structured, traceable observability.

## How this breakdown is ordered

- **Ticket 1 (`walking-skeleton-smoke`) is the cheapest end-to-end slice and becomes the repo smoke
  test.** It runs headless on in-process doubles (no Cue, no network, no mic, no keys): one recorded
  transcript JSONL → a deterministic match → one structured trace line. It legitimately precedes the
  P-CUE "first build task" gate because it imports no third-party surface.
- **`probe-cue-substrate` (P-CUE) is the first *third-party* build task** and the P0 blocker: confirm
  the Cue repo is accessible, build it from source, and prove the policy/`observe.pass`/two-`Program`/
  `MappedActionTool`/provider-slot surface (plus the ≤300 ms `TextCue` latency assertion) against the
  real library. Nothing Cue-dependent is built until it is green.
- **Validate-before-build probes gate the code that depends on them.** P-CUE, P-ASR, P-TTS,
  P-LLM/A-LLM-SUB, P-SMITHERS, P-SEAM are blocking; P-PHONETIC, P-OTEL are warning/informational (folded
  into their consuming tickets). (P-HOOK, P-SPOTTER, P-SHELL-PARSE, P-BUN-NATIVE are **removed** — the
  safety read-back hook, on-device spotter, and shell classifier are cut for V0; see the scope-cut note below.)
- The dependency graph is a **DAG** (verified acyclic): foundations → probes → Cue adapter + ASR
  bridge → routing/vocabulary/intent-gate → audio output + mute → suggestion + acceptance + seam →
  safety + registry/fleet → emergency/onboarding/observability → the canonical spine → latency +
  fleet/durability e2e.

### V0 scope cut (decision update)

The user reviewed the planning run and cut scope to ship V0 fast, run dangerously, and trust the voice
library. The cuts that touch tickets:

- **Run to completion / dangerously (E6/E7/E8/O-Safety).** No per-step approval, no spoken read-back/confirm
  gate, no dead-man timer, no Safe/Explicit/Dangerous modes, no shell classifier. If safety is wanted later
  we **sandbox the whole process**, not gate via permissions. → **Removed tickets:**
  `probe-pretool-safety-hook` (P-HOOK), `safety-execution-boundary-hook`, `shell-command-classifier`,
  `seam-gate-correlation` (the gateId↔UPID approval-correlation map).
- **Mute = "mute", unmute = "unmute" (V1/V2).** Plain-English words; the voice library (Cue) handles
  always-on keyword listening for "unmute" while muted, plus an on-screen unmute button. No bespoke
  on-device spotter. → **Removed ticket:** `probe-keyword-spotter` (P-SPOTTER/P-BUN-NATIVE);
  `mute-controller-and-spotter` → renamed **`mute-controller`**.
- **Ignored ambient speech is SILENT (V4).** `observe.pass`/`route.pass` make no sound; earcons stay for
  explicit state transitions and addressed commands. → `earcons-and-output-policy`, `routing-dispatch-invariants`.
- **Tiered always-hot/state-gated vocabulary deferred (V3).** The voice library handles wake/keyword
  activation; revisit later only if it becomes a problem. → `routing-dispatch-invariants`.
- **Restraint = env-tunable params (E9).** No fixed labeled replay corpus or hard recall/FP metric for V0;
  suggestion cadence/restraint are ENV knobs with documented defaults, tuned by feel. → **Removed ticket:**
  `replay-corpus-contract` (ENG-T-07); `suggestion-engine` restraint is env-tunable.
- **Credentials (E10).** Assume the host is logged into its Codex + Claude subscriptions; no raw keys, no
  `SubscriptionCredentialProvider`/Cerebras/Haiku machinery. → `subscription-credentials-redaction` (now a
  thin no-raw-key guard + redaction filter), `probe-hot-loop-llm-subscription`.

### The §22 round-1 probe learnings, folded into tickets

The round-1 assumption probes ran (2026-06-14); the pipeline is paused pending the remaining blocking
probes. Those amendments are first-class ticket content:

| §22 learning | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Keyword-only `TextCue` is insufficient (80% context FP, 53% natural false-accept) → add a cheap-LLM **intent gate** + whole-utterance pre-filter between keyword and action | `intent-gate-semantic-check` (consumed by `suggestion-engine`, `acceptance-spawn-flow`) |
| Drop the NATO-subset callsigns (`alpha/bravo/charlie/delta/echo` occur in dev speech) → **coined multi-syllable** callsigns | `callsigns-and-collision-guard` |
| Cue has **no built-in Deepgram provider** → build the audio-capture → ASR → Cue WebSocket bridge (ENG-T-10, new scope) | `audio-capture-asr-bridge` |
| Real-time steering needs **gateway mode** (`smithers up --serve`), not detach; call the gateway signal API, not the CLI; install Cue from source | `probe-smithers-durable-runs`, `cue-smithers-seam-dispatcher`, `probe-cue-substrate` |
| Diarization unverified (no `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`) → re-run P-ASR against Deepgram Nova-3; VAD-only fallback if unavailable | `probe-asr-deepgram` |
| Hot-loop model must be reachable via the **host's logged-in subscription** (A-LLM-SUB still open); cost gate $0.15/hr; ACT-prompt fix | `probe-hot-loop-llm-subscription` |
| TTS 1.27 s was a `say` artifact → measure streaming time-to-first-chunk; **pre-cache** the 5 fixed phrases; redesign E4/E5 earcons (ZCR-CV < 0.15); human perceptual test | `probe-streaming-tts`, `earcons-and-output-policy` |

---

## Build phases (topologically ordered)

**Phase 0 — Foundations (headless, no third-party).**
`walking-skeleton-smoke` → `shared-types-contract` → `record-replay-harness`, `provider-interface-doubles`,
`trace-processor-observability` → `subscription-credentials-redaction`; `probe-suite-harness`.

**Phase 1 — Validate-before-build probes (gates).**
`probe-cue-substrate` (P0, first build task), `probe-asr-deepgram`, `probe-hot-loop-llm-subscription`,
`probe-streaming-tts`, `probe-smithers-durable-runs` → `probe-cue-smithers-seam`.

**Phase 2 — Cue substrate & audio ingress.**
`audio-capture-asr-bridge` → `cue-adapter-and-policies`.

**Phase 3 — Routing, vocabulary, intent gate.**
`routing-dispatch-invariants` → `callsigns-and-collision-guard`, `steering-window-lifecycle`,
`intent-gate-semantic-check`.

**Phase 4 — Audio output & mute.**
`earcons-and-output-policy` → `mute-controller`.

**Phase 5 — Suggestion, seam, acceptance.**
`suggestion-engine`; `cue-smithers-seam-dispatcher` → `acceptance-spawn-flow`.

**Phase 6 — Registry, fleet.**
`process-registry-lifecycle-fleet` → `emergency-stop-control`.
*(Safety read-back hook and shell classifier are cut — V0 runs dangerously; safety later is process sandboxing.)*

**Phase 7 — Onboarding, observability, the spine, acceptance e2es.**
`onboarding-consent-persistence-guard`, `observability-trace-and-board`,
`canonical-spine-and-no-screen-harness` → `latency-benchmark-suite`,
`fleet-concurrency-and-durability-e2e`.

## Tickets

Each ticket below lists `id` · complexity · `requirementIds` · `dependsOn`, a short intent, and its
verification mix. Full self-contained instructions live in `artifacts/smithering/tickets.json`.

### Foundations

#### `walking-skeleton-smoke` — *medium* — REQ-5, REQ-16, engineering-only — depends on: —
The cheapest end-to-end slice; **the smoke test**. Bun/Hono scaffold + CI (`bun test`, `tsc --noEmit`),
stub `src/types.ts`, a minimal replay reader, a deterministic wake matcher, a minimal `TraceProcessor`,
and one headless test that drives a 2-line transcript fixture to exactly one structured trace line.
*Verify:* command (smoke test, RBG = break the matcher), command (`bun test`+`tsc` CI gate, RBG = type
error), agent-review (true walking skeleton, doubles only).

#### `shared-types-contract` — *small* — engineering-only — depends on: `walking-skeleton-smoke`
Full ENG-T-01 `src/types.ts` per eng §1.3 (every V0 interface/type + zod mirrors; the cut subsystems' types
— `ExecutionMode`/`setMode`/`approve`/`deny`, `ToolCallContext`/`ShellVerdict`, `ApprovalRequest`/`ApprovalResolution`
— are dropped, E6/E7/E8). *Verify:* command (type-roundtrip + schema-presence, RBG = drop `correlationId`),
agent-review (completeness vs §1.3, cut types absent).

#### `record-replay-harness` — *medium* — engineering-only — depends on: `shared-types-contract`
ENG-T-02 — `src/replay/harness.ts`: JSONL → temp-0 decision loop → hashed, deterministic replay; assert
shape/invariants, never exact text. *Verify:* command (determinism, RBG = inject nondeterminism),
command (invariant helpers), agent-review (single seam over the AI surface).

#### `provider-interface-doubles` — *small* — engineering-only, REQ-1, REQ-10 — depends on: `shared-types-contract`
ENG-T-04 — typed provider boundary (`ASRProvider`/`TTSProvider`/`DecisionLLM`; no `KeywordSpotter` — the
on-device spotter is cut, V2) + replay/noop doubles + architecture lint, modular and trivially mockable
(E2). *Verify:* command (boundary-substitution + conformance, RBG = concrete import), agent-review (no
bespoke spotter provider; injection everywhere).

#### `trace-processor-observability` — *medium* — REQ-16, engineering-only — depends on: `shared-types-contract`
ENG-T-03 — `src/obs/trace.ts` pipeline stage; verb-noun `LogEvent`, stable ids, measured `latencyMs`,
correlationId chain query, redaction seam. *Verify:* command (trace-schema + causal-chain + pass-logging,
RBG = drop `correlationId`), command (roundtrip), agent-review (no-context reconstruction).

#### `subscription-credentials-redaction` — *medium* — SEC-1, REQ-16, engineering-only — depends on: `shared-types-contract`, `trace-processor-observability`
ENG-T-09 — thin no-raw-key guard (model access from the host's logged-in Codex/Claude subscriptions; raw
key rejected — no `SubscriptionCredentialProvider`/Cerebras/Haiku machinery, E10) + fail-closed redaction
filter. *Verify:* command (no-raw-key + secret-redaction, RBG = disable filter), e2e (whole-session
secret-scan, RBG = plant a key), agent-review (no raw keys in source, fail-closed).

#### `probe-suite-harness` — *small* — engineering-only — depends on: `walking-skeleton-smoke`
ENG-T-05 — `poc/` harness: real-API probe runner, RBG recording, report writer, secret-scan. *Verify:*
command (sample probe writes report + RBG, refuses non-failable assertions), agent-review (failures
surfaced, not swallowed).

### Validate-before-build probes

#### `probe-cue-substrate` — *large* — REQ-1/3/5/6/7 — depends on: `probe-suite-harness`
**P-CUE (P0 blocker, first third-party build task).** Confirm repo access, build Cue from source,
exercise every §11.1 primitive + the ≤300 ms `TextCue` latency assertion; record the WebSocket
transcription ingress shape (no built-in Deepgram provider). *Verify:* command (each §11.1 row failable),
command (TextCue-latency, RBG = 50 ms budget), agent-review (repo access + fallback verdict).

#### `probe-asr-deepgram` — *medium* — REQ-1, REQ-10 — depends on: `probe-suite-harness`, `subscription-credentials-redaction`
**P-ASR (P0, re-run).** Deepgram Nova-3: isFinal, diarization labels, <200 ms word-final, silence→no-obs,
subscription credential. *Verify:* command (each failable, RBG = <50 ms), command (secret-redaction),
agent-review (diarization stability vs VAD fallback).

#### `probe-hot-loop-llm-subscription` — *medium* — REQ-3, REQ-10, engineering-only — depends on: `probe-suite-harness`, `subscription-credentials-redaction`
**P-LLM + A-LLM-SUB (P0).** Cheap/fast hot-loop model via the host's logged-in Codex/Claude subscription

**P-SMITHERS (P0, hardening A3 PASS).** spawn/stream/pause/resume/steer/recovery/concurrent + fork
realization; **gateway mode** (not CLI/detach). *Verify:* command (each lifecycle op failable, RBG =
disable checkpointing), agent-review (fork verdict + gateway path).

#### `probe-cue-smithers-seam` — *medium* — REQ-4/8/13/15 — depends on: `probe-cue-substrate`, `probe-smithers-durable-runs`
**P-SEAM (P0, top integration risk).** Cue `MappedActionTool` action round-trips into a real Smithers
run; SSE run-events flow back; spawn ≤3 s non-blocking; reconnect; UPID↔window. (No approval/read-back
round-trip — V0 runs dangerously, E6/E7.) *Verify:* command (round-trip failable, RBG = make dispatch
blocking), agent-review (bidirectional/async, spawn round-trip).

> *(Cut from Phase 1: `probe-pretool-safety-hook` (P-HOOK), `seam-gate-correlation`, and
> `probe-keyword-spotter` (P-SPOTTER/P-BUN-NATIVE) — the safety read-back hook and on-device spotter are

#### `audio-capture-asr-bridge` — *medium* — REQ-1 — depends on: `probe-cue-substrate`, `probe-asr-deepgram`
**ENG-T-10 (new scope, §22 A1.3).** Mic PCM → `ASRProvider` → JSON transcript events → Cue WebSocket
`/sessions/:id/transcription`; honors the mute fork + persistence guard; VAD fallback if no diarization.
*Verify:* command (well-formed events, no PCM written, RBG = PCM writer), e2e (real ingress), agent-review
(single audio→Cue path).

#### `cue-adapter-and-policies` — *large* — REQ-1/3/5/6/7 — depends on: `probe-cue-substrate`, `shared-types-contract`, `audio-capture-asr-bridge`
§3 — `src/cue/` harness/adapter/policies/programs: normalize observations, log decisions, hot-plane
earcon source, two independent `Program`s, owned extensions as risks (D2). *Verify:* command
(normalization/pass-logging/two-Program/recognition-source, RBG = ambient→steering), e2e (earcon ≤300 ms
while LLM delayed), agent-review (nothing Cue re-implemented).

### Routing, vocabulary, intent gate

#### `routing-dispatch-invariants` — *large* — REQ-6/7/8/12 — depends on: `cue-adapter-and-policies`
§4 — `src/routing/`: priority ladder, routing exclusivity, dispatch invariant, tiered vocabulary,
one-handler-per-command (status/pauseAll/pause/resume/setMode), NL out of scope (NG-2). *Verify:* command
(priority/dispatch-invariant/tier-gating/determinism/command-coverage, RBG = remove guard), e2e
(un-addressed never steers; one-breath; Atlas-pause), agent-review (no LLM authority).

#### `callsigns-and-collision-guard` — *medium* — REQ-7/13 — depends on: `routing-dispatch-invariants`

#### `intent-gate-semantic-check` — *medium* — REQ-3/4/7 — depends on: `routing-dispatch-invariants`, `cue-adapter-and-policies`, `probe-hot-loop-llm-subscription`
**§22 A5.1/A5.3 (critical).** Cheap-LLM intent check + whole-utterance pre-filter between `TextCue` and
any spawn/control action; off the ≤300 ms earcon path; temp-0 deterministic. *Verify:* command
('yes, but…' → no action, RBG = remove gate), e2e (corpus FP/false-accept drop, RBG = shuffle labels),
agent-review (off hot path, ACT-prompt fix).

### Audio output & mute

Layer-B acks (AC6.4), 15-word guard, never-recite, mute/halt/read-back length rules, timeout "working"
ack, pre-cached phrases. *Verify:* command (latency/disjoint/guard/acks/timeout, RBG per row), e2e

zero-obs-while-muted; unmute via the Cue "unmute" keyword OR an on-screen unmute button (no bespoke
on-device spotter, V2); `mute.heartbeat`. *Verify:* command (mute-latency/no-obs/unmute-paths, RBG = leave
pipeline open), e2e (mute→unmute, zero audio on disk), agent-review (heartbeat proves closed path; two
unmute paths; no spotter).

### Suggestion, seam, acceptance

§6 — gate (≥60 words OR ≥90 s) AND quality AND interrupt-cost; queue/idle delivery; 90 s expiry; ≤12-word
pitch + ≤3 MCQs; ALL restraint params are ENV-tunable knobs with documented defaults, tuned by feel (no
labeled corpus / hard recall metric, E9); hands `PendingSuggestion` to §7. *Verify:* command (gate-boundary/
MCQ/interrupt-cost/expiry/env-knobs, RBG = lower threshold), e2e (idle-preference + sub-floor→pass, RBG =
zero out interrupt cost), agent-review (`observe.pass`-first; restraint params are env knobs).

§9 (bet #3) — `src/seam/`: async dispatcher (full action set: spawn/steer/pause/resume/halt/pauseAll/status;
no approve/deny — V0 runs dangerously, E6/E7), gateway signal client, SSE run-event normalizer (≤15-word

command (exactly-one-spawn/seed/auto-select/tier-gating, RBG = decline→spawn), e2e (accept→durable
process ≤3 s; skip→no-op), agent-review (full causal chain via intent gate).

### Registry, fleet

> *(Cut for V0: `shell-command-classifier` (ENG-T-08) and `safety-execution-boundary-hook` (the in-run
> PreToolUse read-back/confirm hook + Safe/Explicit/Dangerous modes). Panopticon V0 **runs to completion,
> dangerously** — no per-action approval gate, no shell gating, E6/E7/E8. Safety later is process sandboxing.)*

§10 — `src/process/`: UPID registry (max 2, status), lifecycle (planning→active⇄paused→dead, pre-kill
archive, restart recovery), per-process pause/resume, pre-spawn resource check (capacity + headroom +
refusal ack). *Verify:* command (concurrent/isolation/lifecycle/recovery/resource-check, RBG = remove
check), e2e (steer A / pause B, unselected progress, capacity refusal), agent-review (unselected ≠ paused,
no NL pause).

#### `emergency-stop-control` — *small* — REQ-14 — depends on: `process-registry-lifecycle-fleet`

restarts unmuted, RBG = resume-in-place).

### Onboarding, observability, the spine, acceptance e2es

#### `onboarding-consent-persistence-guard` — *medium* — REQ-1 — depends on: `earcons-and-output-policy`, `audio-capture-asr-bridge`
§12 (R2) — consent scheduler (states "Only transcripts are saved", names the mute word "mute", ≤3 s, once/session),
listening indicator (E2 authoritative), whole-session raw-audio guard (code invariant), near-miss +
first-run VAD. *Verify:* command (scheduler/content/indicator/guard, RBG = drop transcript-only sentence),

invariant).

#### `observability-trace-and-board` — *medium* — REQ-16 — depends on: `trace-processor-observability`, `cue-smithers-seam-dispatcher`
§13 — causal-chain reconstruction across Cue JSONL + Smithers traces; OTel→Langfuse (P-OTEL); read-only

§10/§6 — integrate the wake→intent→action→confirm spine under one `correlationId`; stage-sequencer;
no-screen harness; degradation test (fleet disabled → spine still passes). *Verify:* command
(stage-sequencer happy + 4 failure branches, RBG = drop ack), e2e (≥9/10 + zero GUI events + degradation,
RBG = broken dispatcher), agent-review (single-correlationId reconstruction, audible legibility).

#### `latency-benchmark-suite` — *medium* — REQ-10 — depends on: `canonical-spine-and-no-screen-harness`
REQ-10 — ≥100 round-trips: p50 <1 s, p95 <1.5 s, earcon <300 ms, timeout ack; recorded regression
baseline. *Verify:* e2e (benchmark, RBG = 100 ms budget / throttle provider), command (timeout-ack, RBG =
remove RoundTripTimer), agent-review (baseline fails on regression).

## How the implementation workflow consumes this

- The machine copy is `artifacts/smithering/tickets.json` (`{ "tickets": [...] }`); the implementation
  workflow imports it. Each `id` is a **stable, durable Smithers task id** — do not renumber.
- `dependsOn[]` is a verified **DAG** (acyclic, all references resolve). Schedule in topological order;
  `walking-skeleton-smoke` is first (the smoke test) and the blocking probes gate their dependents.
- Every ticket's `verification[]` maps to a `bun test` path / e2e / agent-review drawn from
  `docs/planning/04-backpressure.md`; a blocking gate must show its named test **passing with a recorded
  red-before-green**. A gate with no failable test — or whose only evidence is "the agent said it's
  done" — blocks merge.
- **Blocking probe failures are surfaced to the orchestrator's gate, not engineered around.** Per §22,
  the round-1 probes already paused the pipeline pending the remaining blocking probes and the amendments
  folded in here (intent gate, coined callsigns, the ASR→Cue bridge, gateway-mode signalling, the $0.15/hr
  cost gate, the earcon redesign, the A-LLM-SUB host-subscription check). (P-SPOTTER, P-SHELL-PARSE, and
  P-HOOK are removed — the on-device spotter, shell classifier, and safety read-back hook are cut for V0.)
