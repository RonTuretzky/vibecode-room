# Central Park visual improvement audit

Active objective: improve the scene across detail, graphical quality and all
other visible aspects until the full result has been inspected and no required
work remains. This audit records open work; a green regression suite does not
prove that the visual objective has been achieved.

## Evidence from the current pass — 2026-09-06

- The corrected outline restores parkland formerly replaced by city paving.
- The city now has mapped streets, pavement, curbs and perimeter walls. Broad
  road surfaces share the terrain, resolving visible white clipping patches.
- A refreshed walking network and 146 accepted mapped perimeter trees restore
  detail along the newly recovered park edge in the live two-project room.
- Distinct roughness and relief maps improve window/masonry separation;
  lighter haze makes nearby buildings easier to distinguish.
- The Pond, crowns and bank improvements from the preceding pass remain.
- Walks now grade their terrain corridors and clip at the shoreline instead
  of being dropped on steep banks. Source stair tags produce treads/risers;
  surface tags distinguish paved and natural routes. These changes pass
  geometry/source-data checks and full-renderer screenshot inspection.
- Adaptive path triangles and shared vertices reduce the initial dense pass
  from 518k triangles/1.55M vertices to 198k/201k. A real-data centroid check
  finds no buried walk/stair triangles in the 400 m southern neighbourhood.

## Observed work still to resolve

1. **Walk continuity and terrain grading.** Full-renderer captures now show
   connected shore walks and clean junctions. The first captures caught edging
   through intersections and abrupt DEM-based banks; both were corrected and
   rechecked. Continue low-angle inspection of stair transitions and modeled
   grades as camera exploration improves. Contour-based bank grades now remove
   grid-direction bias and fade into the surrounding DEM; the new render was
   inspected. The camera now keeps terrain/deck/water-relative eye clearance;
   a hardware route reached the low shore and climbed back over the hillside
   without dropping below it. Close captures exposed sparse turf detail, now
   supplemented by short, solid blades and finer ground texture scale.
   The user's existing tab still needs
   a direct visit once the Mac is unlocked.
2. **Architecture.** Nearby buildings now have recessed roofs, parapets,
   coping, roof grain and low rooftop housings within source height/footprint
   bounds. Extra collinear survey vertices no longer disable tower setbacks.
   Full-renderer review caught and resolved hollow parapet shadows; complete
   building bodies and landmark models now cast consistent shadows. The Arsenal
   now has its mapped footprint and height, eight octagonal towers, brick and
   granite materials, framed windows, crenellations and raised entrance. Its
   first GPU capture exposed a missing entrance/walk connection, now joined by
   a short inferred apron. Wollman now has its mapped curved clubhouse, roof
   terrace, slatted canopy, patio and service building. Full-renderer inspection
   caught a grassy patio gap and roof-edge approach issue; both were corrected.
   The Zoo now has its mapped exterior pavilions, open galleries, tropical-house
   glazing, central pool and an illustrative clock with three open arches.
   The first render exposed a crowded camera composition, dark small water
   bodies and courtyard grading; all were refined and checked in a fresh
   hardware capture. Fifth Avenue hotel
   crowns, Zoo enclosures/interiors, sculptural details and the rink's seasonal
   fit-out remain incomplete. Architectural details remain interpretive.
3. **Ground materials and transitions.** Perimeter hexagonal/granite paving,
   path margins, schist outcrops, contact shading and woodland floor detail
   need close-view inspection. The first slope/woodland layer adds mineral grain
   and small leaf fragments in the existing terrain draw, verified in a hardware
   render. Continue checking texture repetition and prop contact.
4. **Vegetation and atmosphere.** Grove foliage now has gentle, phased crown
   motion with matching shadow deformation and a live reduced-motion stop. The
   hardware test compiled both shaders and recorded all presets with motion
   enabled. A new low shrub layer supplies clustered undergrowth on wooded
   ground, with tapered branches, human-scale leaf sprays, a 900-plant cap and
   camera-distance culling. It avoids paths, water, steep grades and the stage;
   full-renderer Pond and overview captures were inspected. Crown density,
   woodland floor materials, grass scale, sky detail and
   water shading still warrant further work. Small-basin ripples now use an
   irregular seamless spectrum with softer highlights and reduced-motion
   support; the change was checked in the Zoo render. Species forms remain approximate.
5. **Composition and UI.** Inspect camera routes and readable project content
   in normal and Zen modes, portrait and landscape. Preserve shared spatial
   controls and planting/branch interaction. The fresh 32/64-project fixture
   exposed an automatic single-row layout that forced Fit too far away. Compact
   terrain-aware slots now reduce its radius from 435/872 m to 169/256 m;
   chosen planting positions retain their override. In the mature-tree fixture,
   distant branch-tip cards still obscure crowns. Selecting through Projects
   opens controls but does not bring a distant tree closer; the menu can overlap
   the top controls. Inspect that focus/label behavior next.
6. **Cost and lifecycle.** Re-measure a large project forest, transitions and
   repeated rebuilds. Audit cached world/atlas lifetimes, reflection/shadow
   cadence, resolution adaptation and long-frame behavior. Six environment
   rebuild cycles now show stable GPU resource counts after warmup, including
   recreating the close turf. The fresh 64-mature-tree fixture has six branch
   tips per tree and measures roughly 2,900 draw calls / 18–19 ms average frames
   at 2× resolution on this M4 Max, with p95 around 27 ms. Reduce distant chrome
   work while retaining branch picking at useful distances. Brief local frame
   samples are not a cross-device performance guarantee.

## Completion remains unproven

Continue actual rendering work and visual inspection. Verification must cover
the completed scene and its user interactions, including local-AI project
flows where changes affect them. Do not treat this inventory, partial source
coverage or unit/browser checks as proof that the full objective is complete.
